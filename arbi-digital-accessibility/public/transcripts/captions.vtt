Web Accessibility Perspectives.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Text-to-speech.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000
A man is using a laptop with the text on the screen being highlighted as it is spoken.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Some people can see the text on the screen.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Fortunately, computers can convert text-to-speech.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.000
It's technology that many people who are blind have been relying on for years.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
A service dog is next to the man. He may be blind.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
But it's also important for many people with dyslexia.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
A woman is reading on a tablet and listening with headphones.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
And very useful for people with difficulty reading text.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.000
A man removes his glasses and listens to a news article on a tablet.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
As well as some people who just like to multitask.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
A man listens to a magazine article as they do the washing.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
But for this to work, websites and apps have to be properly coded.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000
A website is not properly working for the woman with headphones. She is frustrated.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:01.000
Which has the added benefit of helping search engines index websites' contents better.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:07.000
The man with the service dog is using his mobile device outside with bone conduction headphones.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000
Different people from earlier are shown using text-to-speech.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
Web Accessibility.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
Essential for some.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
Useful for all.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:25.000
